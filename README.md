# joy - a preprocessor metaprogramming library
`joy` is a preprocessor metaprogramming library built on top of the `chaos`
library. It is ANSI-C compliant.


## Getting started
`joy` is a header only library. However, you will need the `chaos` library
to be installed and in your compiler's include path. If you do not already
have `chaos`, it is provided as a submodule.
